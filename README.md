# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

Data Pipeline: 
• Structured modular data pipeline using separate Python scripts for ingestion, 
validation, transformation, and storage. 
• YAML-based config management and artifact tracking with DVC. 
Model Architecture & Training: 
• Modular training loop built from scratch using scikit-learn. 
• Encapsulated models as services using OOP principles for reusability. 
Deployment/Serving Setup: 
• End-to-end pipeline containerized via Docker. 
• Integrated CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions (automated build, test, push stages). 
• API exposure via FastAPI for production readiness. 
Monitoring/Alerting: 
• Unit test coverage for all modules. 
• GitHub Actions test logs + Docker layer caching + ML pipeline logging. 
• Ready for Prometheus/Grafana integration for runtime monitoring.
